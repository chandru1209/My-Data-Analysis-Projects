Revised Data Analysis:
Objective: Cyclistic aims to increase annual memberships by understanding user behavior and implementing targeted marketing strategies.

1.	Understanding Rider Behavior:
o	Analyzed 12 months of bike trip data from Cyclistic servers.
o	Merged and cleaned data for better analysis.
o	Calculated ride length in seconds, eliminating extreme values.
o	Plotted ride length grouped by rider type.
o	Identified that casual riders prefer electric bikes for longer rides, while members opt for classic bikes on shorter trips.

3.	Identifying User Patterns:
o	Examined daily and monthly usage patterns for both casual riders and members.
o	Casual riders show a preference for weekend rides, suggesting the potential for weekend passes.
o	Increased member usage on weekdays, but identified months (June-September) with higher utilization.
o	Proposed holding periods for members during low-usage months to enhance member retention.

5.	Location-Based Strategies:
o	Mapped origin and ending points of rides for both casual riders and members.
o	Identified specific locations where campaigns can be run to retain annual members.
o	Targeted spots frequented by casual riders for campaigns promoting the benefits of annual membership.

7.	Challenges and Further Steps:
o	Lack of individual user data poses a challenge in understanding and targeting potential annual members.
o	Suggested the creation of a user ID column to better identify and approach users for week and monthly passes.


9.	Future Strategies:
o	Classify ride locations into residential, office, or tourist spots for targeted collaborations.
o	Consider introducing weekday and monthly passes for tourists and residents.
o	Collaborate with businesses in identified locations for increased revenue and membership growth.
